## Introduction

Welcome to the Tips Seaborn Dataset Analysis project! This project explores and analyzes the famous tips dataset using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset provides information about the bills, tips, and various attributes of customers in a restaurant, helping to uncover insights about tipping behavior and relationships between different variables.

## Project Features
* Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in tipping behavior.
* Visualization of relationships between variables using seaborn.
* Statistical analysis on factors affecting tip amounts.
* Step-by-step analysis using code and visualization techniques.

## Technologies Used
* Python: Main language used for the analysis.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* Matplotlib: For plotting basic graphs.
* Seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations.

### Key Analysis & Visualizations
1) Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Distribution of total bills and tips.
* Correlation between total bill, tip amount, and other variables like gender, day of the week, and smoker status.
* Relationship between party size and tip percentage.

2) Visualizations:

* Scatter plots for visualizing relationships between variables.
* Heatmaps to show correlations.
* Boxplots and violin plots for understanding distributions and variations.

### Sample Visualizations

* A scatter plot showing the relationship between total bill and tips.
